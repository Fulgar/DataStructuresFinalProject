This project was completed as my Final Project for my Data Structures course @ Kennesaw State University.

The goal of the project was to pick and choose either a Data Structure or Algorithm to research, write a paper, and build an implementation of it using C++.

I chose to study Dijkstra's Algorithm. My implementation includes a Graph environment which uses Node and Edge objects.
The edge objects contain weights. For the actual execution of the algorithm I manually created nodes and edges for the sake of simplicity for being able to follow a single graph in my included research paper.
